##Best Practices CV and LinkedIn Building##

<i>CVs</i>
- Please send through your CV in a Word-file(.doc/.docx). This way we can provide in-text comments on draft versions, using Track & Changes as well as more general comments. A final Word-version will be shared with Wouter, who converts it to PDF before sharing it with prospective companies. You can also use the final version to send to companies.

- Use a basic template provided by HYF. You can edit these examples <a href="https://github.com/HackYourFuture/alumni/blob/master/Sample_CV_1.doc">here and <a href="https://github.com/HackYourFuture/alumni/blob/master/Sample_CV_2.doc">here</a>.

- We suggest to keep your CV basic and clean. Date of birth, marital status and country of origin are not necessary.

- Please do not use any crazy CV templates or online tools. Two reasons why we advise not to use them:
1)They make it very difficult for us to provide suggestions and;
2)usually require a subscription to update your CV in the future.

- Some of of you might have limited work experience. In such a case a bit more creativity is required. Education can be featured on top. Often, participation in the HackYourFuture course can be featured first. It might be useful to spend a few lines of text on describing your project you worked on. See the CV examples (above) for examples. 

- Work experience not related to web development should be listed on the CV if these skills used are relevant. For instance, if you have been a project manager in the past, this shows leadership skills. If you worked in a store, this shows commercial awareness.

- No surprise, but grammar and spelling mistakes are unacceptable.

- The summary-statement on top should not be longer than 2-3 sentences. Keep it simple.

- A photograph can help. We stress that the use of a photograph is only advised when the photo actually looks professional

- It is not the job of HYF and its volunteers to re-write your CV. We can provide in-text comments and general advice, but you will have to do most of the work.

- Make sure to only list skills/competencies (soft and technical) you actually possess. 10+ skills are overkill.

<i>LinkedIn</i>
- Use a professional photo

- Make sure to list your skills, this can be picked up by recruiters. If contacted by recruiters, make sure to note that HYF will charge a placement fee (for both internships and job offers).

- Keep your headline brief
